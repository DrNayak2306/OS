# Types of OS

## 1. Batch OS
programs were written in magnetic tape etc.. and given to operator  
who loaded them in batches.  
Idle time for I/O inevitable.

## 2. Multiprogrammed OS
Bring as many processes as possible into the RAM. No idle time.  
Non preemptive - Focus on a single process until interrupt / terminate.

## 3. Multitasking / Time sharing OS
All processes are given equal attention <=> responsiveness

## 4. Real time OS
Tasks completed within a specified time frame.  
hard - no delays tolerated (for national security etc..)  
soft - some delay tolerated (for gaming etc..)

## 5. Distributed / Clustered OS
One OS runs across multiple physically separate computers in a network.

## 6. Embedded OS
Minimal OS handling fixed functionality (Instructions fixed.)
